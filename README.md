Chaser FOV Tool
============
It's a simple program that allows you to modify the FOV in Chaser.exe. As of note - the FOV written to a exe is calculated as hor+, so FOV value provided by a user is being increased from 4:3 aspect ratio to a desired aspect ratio - you don't have to bother with increasing FOV value, because of vert- FOV scaling - program has it covered!
