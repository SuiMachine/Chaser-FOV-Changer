Chaser FOV Tool
============
It's a simple program that allows you to modify the FOV in Chaser.exe. As of note - the FOV written to a exe is calculated as hor+, so FOV value provided by a user is being increased from 4:3 aspect ratio to a desired aspect ratio - you don't have to bother with increasing FOV value, because of vert- FOV scaling - program has it covered!

Note: FOV value is also stored in your save file. For the changes to apply, an instruction has to be called, which is going to apply it. In short, if you load a save file and nothing changes, use a scope from your rifle, play normally till next level or a cutscene which actually adjusts camera FOV.
